## Motivation

I am considering developing a sports game similar to The Bitmap Brothers's classic Speedball 2. Convincing player AI is a major part of any team based game so tackling this seemed like a good place to start. That naturally led me to the book Programming Game AI by Example by Mat Buckland.
